        <h3>A short history of Garfields rise to fame</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Before <strong>1978</strong> Garfield was on the rise to becoming a main character in his own comic strip</li>
          <li>The Garfield Sunday strip was launched on <strong>June 25, 1978</strong></li>
          <li>The comic strip was available only at a third-page size until <strong>March 22, 1981</strong></li>
          <li>A half-page debuted the following Sunday, <strong>March 29</strong></li>
          <li>The Sunday strips for March 14 and 21, <strong>1982</strong>, tried out a unique nine-panel format</li>
          <li>The strip underwent stylistic changes, evolving from the style of the 1976â€“83 strips, to a more cartoonish look from <strong>1984</strong> onward</li>
          <li>In <strong>1981</strong>, less than three years after its nationwide launch, the strip appeared in 850 newspapers and accumulated over $15 million in merchandise</li>
          <li>In <strong>1982</strong> the strip was appearing in more than 1,000 newspapers</li>
          <li>By <strong>2002</strong>, Garfield became the world's most syndicated strip, appearing in 2,570 newspapers with 263 million readers worldwide</li>
          <li>By <strong>2004</strong>, Garfield appeared in nearly 2,600 newspapers and sold from $750 million to $1 billion worth of merchandise in 111 countries</li>
